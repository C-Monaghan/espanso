## Introduction

<img align="right" width="350" src="https://i.ibb.co/0GTVC02/espanso-octocat.png">

[Espanso](https://espanso.org/) is an open source, privacy-first, cross-platform text expander developed by [@federico-terzi](https://github.com/federico-terzi) and written in Rust. In short, it detects when you type a certain keyword, and replaces it on the fly with a pre-defined string or dynamic output.

It uses a file-based configuration, written entirely in YAML, and for the most part is quick and easy to it it configured exactly to your liking. It runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux, and works with pretty much any program. Espanso not only supports simple text replacement/ expansion, but also images, custom scripts and shell commands, app-specific configurations and built-in date support.
